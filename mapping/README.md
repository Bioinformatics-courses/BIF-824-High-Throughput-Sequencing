# Map reads on a reference genome
Sequence read mapping is  refer to the process to align the reads on a reference genomes. 
A  mapping  tool (mapper) required as input two set of files:
1. An indexed reference genome
2. A set of reads (Often fastq files). 

Mapper align each read in the set of reads on the reference genome. Some mappers perform exact matching, while others allow  mismatches, indels and clipping of some short fragments on the two ends of the reads.
